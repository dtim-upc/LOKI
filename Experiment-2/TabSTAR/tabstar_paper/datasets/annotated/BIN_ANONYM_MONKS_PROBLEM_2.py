**The Monk's Problems: Problem 2**  
Once upon a time, in July 1991, the monks of Corsendonk Priory were faced with a school held in their priory, namely the 2nd European Summer School on Machine Learning. After listening more than one week to a wide variety of learning algorithms, they felt rather confused: Which algorithm would be optimal? And which one to avoid? As a consequence of this dilemma, they created a simple task on which all learning algorithms ought to be compared: the three MONK's problems.

The target concept associated with the 2nd Monk's problem is the binary outcome of the logical formula:  
MONK-2: EXACTLY TWO of {a1 = 1, a2 = 1, a3 = 1, a4 = 1, a5 = 1, a6 = 1}

In this dataset, the original train and test sets were merged to allow other sampling procedures. However, the original train-test splits can be found as one of the OpenML tasks.
