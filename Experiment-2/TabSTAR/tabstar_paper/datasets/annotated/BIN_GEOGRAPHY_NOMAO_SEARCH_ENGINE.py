1. Data set title:
Nomao Data Set 


2. Abstract: 
Nomao collects data about places (name, phone, localization...) from many sources. Deduplication consists in detecting what data refer to the same place. Instances in the dataset compare 2 spots.

3. Data Set Characteristics:  

- Univariate
- Area: Computer
- Attribute Characteristics: Real
- Associated Tasks: Classification
- Missing Values?: Yes

5. Data Set Information:

The dataset has been enriched during the Nomao Challenge: organized along with the ALRA workshop (Active Learning in Real-world Applications): held at the ECML-PKDD 2012 conference.

5.1. Number of Instances

34,465 instances, mix of continuous and nominal, labeled by human expert.

First 29,104 instances have been labeled with "human prior".
See the corresponding article described in section "3. Past Usage" for more details.

Next 917 instances have been labeled using the active learning method called "marg".
Next 964 instances refer to the active method called "wmarg".
Next 995 instances refer to the active method called "wmarg5".
Next 1,985 instances refer to the active method called "rand" (random selection).

Last instances have been labeled during the corresponding challenge.
More details can be found in http://www.nomao.com/labs/challenge
Next 163 instances refer to the active method called "baseline".
Next 167 instances refer to the active method called "nomao".
And last 170 instances refer to the active method called "tsun".

5.2. Number of Attributes 

120 attributes: 89 continuous, 31 nominal (including the attributes 'label' and 'id'). 

The features are separated by comma.

5.3. Attribute Information: 

Missing data are allowed, represented by question marks '?'.

Labels are +1 if the concerned spots must be merged, -1 if they do not refer to the same entity.

1 id: name is composed of the names of the spots that are compared, separated by a sharp (#).
