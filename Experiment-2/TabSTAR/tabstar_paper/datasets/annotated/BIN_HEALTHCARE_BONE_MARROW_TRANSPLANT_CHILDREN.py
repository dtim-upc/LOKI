Description: Dataset Information
Additional Information

The data set describes pediatric patients with several hematologic diseases: malignant disorders (i.a. acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome) and nonmalignant cases (i.a. severe aplastic anemia, Fanconi anemia, with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy). All patients were subject to the unmanipulated allogeneic unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
 
The motivation of the study was to identify the most important factors influencing the success or failure of the transplantation procedure. In particular, the aim was to verify the hypothesis that increased dosage of CD34+ cells / kg extends overall survival time without simultaneous occurrence of undesirable events affecting patients' quality of life (Ka wah, et al., 2010).

The data set has been used in our work concerning survival rules (Wrobel et al., 2017) and user-guided rule induction (Sikora et al., 2019). The authors of the research on stem cell transplantation (Ka wah, et al., 2010) who inspired our study also contributed to the set.
