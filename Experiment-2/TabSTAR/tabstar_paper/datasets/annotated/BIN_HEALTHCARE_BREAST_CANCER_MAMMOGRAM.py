Description: Context
This dataset includes data from a random sample of 20,000 digital and 20,000 film-screen mammograms received by women age 60-89 years within the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) between January 2005 and December 2008. Some women contribute multiple examinations to the dataset. Data is useful in teaching about data analysis, epidemiological study designs, or statistical methods for binary outcomes or correlated data.
Content
The data set contains 39998 rows and  13 cols. Attributes are described as follows:
