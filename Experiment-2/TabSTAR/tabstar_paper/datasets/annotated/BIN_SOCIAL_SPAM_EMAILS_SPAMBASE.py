SPAM E-mail Database  
The "spam" concept is diverse: advertisements for products/websites, make money fast schemes, chain letters, pornography... Our collection of spam e-mails came from our postmaster and individuals who had filed spam.  Our collection of non-spam e-mails came from filed work and personal e-mails, and hence the word 'george' and the area code '650' are indicators of non-spam.  These are useful when constructing a personalized spam filter.  One would either have to blind such non-spam indicators or get a very wide collection of non-spam to generate a general purpose spam filter.
 
For background on spam:  
Cranor, Lorrie F., LaMacchia, Brian A.  Spam! Communications of the ACM, 41(8):74-83, 1998.  

### Attribute Information:  
The last column denotes whether the e-mail was considered spam (1) or not (0), i.e. unsolicited commercial e-mail. Most of the attributes indicate whether a particular word or character was frequently occurring in the e-mail. The run-length attributes (55-57) measure the length of sequences of consecutive capital letters.  

For the statistical measures of each attribute, see the end of this file. Here are the definitions of the attributes:  

48 continuous real [0,100] attributes of type  
word_freq_WORD = percentage of words in the e-mail that match WORD,  i.e. 100 * (number of times the WORD appears in the e-mail) / total number of words in e-mail.  A "word" in this case is any string of alphanumeric characters bounded by non-alphanumeric characters or end-of-string.
 
6 continuous real [0,100] attributes of type char_freq_CHAR = percentage of characters in the e-mail that match CHAR, i.e. 100 * (number of CHAR occurences) / total characters in e-mail
 
1 continuous real [1,...] attribute of type capital_run_length_average
 = average length of uninterrupted sequences of capital letters
 
1 continuous integer [1,...] attribute of type capital_run_length_longest
 = length of longest uninterrupted sequence of capital letters
 
1 continuous integer [1,...] attribute of type capital_run_length_total
 = sum of length of uninterrupted sequences of capital letters
 = total number of capital letters in the e-mail
 
1 nominal {0,1} class attribute of type spam
 = denotes whether the e-mail was considered spam (1) or not (0), 
 i.e. unsolicited commercial e-mail.
