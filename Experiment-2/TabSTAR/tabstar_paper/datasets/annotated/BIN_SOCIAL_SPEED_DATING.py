Description: **Author**: Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar  
**Source**: [Columbia Business School](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/speed.dating/) - 2004  
**Please cite**: None  

This data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four-minute "first date" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests. The dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process. These fields include: demographics, dating habits, self-perception across key attributes, beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate, and lifestyle information.
