LED display data set
This simple domain contains 7 Boolean attributes and 10 classes, the set of decimal digits. Recall that LED displays contain 7 light-emitting diodes -- hence the reason for 7 attributes. The class attribute is an integer ranging between 0 and 9 inclusive, representing the possible digits show on the display.

The problem would be easy if not for the introduction of noise. In this case, each attribute value has the 10% probability of having its value inverted.

It's valuable to know the optimal Bayes rate for these databases. In this case, the misclassification rate is 26% (74% classification accuracy).

Attribute Information
V1-V7 represent each of the 7 LEDs, with values either 0 or 1, according to whether the corresponding light is on or not for the decimal digit. Each has a 10% percent chance of being inverted.
