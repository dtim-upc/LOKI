 3. Past Usage:
    This data set have been used to try different simplification methods
    for decision trees. A summary of the results can be found in:
 
    Malerba, D., Esposito, F., and Semeraro, G.
    "A Further Comparison of Simplification Methods for Decision-Tree Induction."
    In D. Fisher and H. Lenz (Eds.), "Learning  from Data: 
    Artificial Intelligence and Statistics V", Lecture Notes in Statistics,
    Springer Verlag, Berlin, 1995.
 
    The problem consists in classifying all the blocks of the page
    layout of a document that has been detected by a segmentation
    process. This is an essential step in document analysis
    in order to separate text from graphic areas. Indeed, 
    the five classes are: text (1), horizontal line (2),
    picture (3), vertical line (4) and graphic (5).
    For a detailed presentation of the problem see:
 
     Esposito F., Malerba D., & Semeraro G.
   Multistrategy Learning for Document Recognition
          Applied Artificial Intelligence, 8, pp. 33-84, 1994
 
    All instances have been personally checked so that
    low noise is present in the data.
 
 4. Relevant Information Paragraph:
 
    The 5473 examples comes from 54 distinct documents. 
    Each observation concerns one block. 
    All attributes are numeric.
    Data are in a format readable by C4.5.
 
 5. Number of Instances: 5473.
 
 6. Number of Attributes 
 
    height:   integer.         | Height of the block.
    lenght:   integer.     | Length of the block. 
    area:     integer.    | Area of the block (height * lenght);
    eccen:    continuous.  | Eccentricity of the block (lenght / height);
    p_black:  continuous.  | Percentage of black pixels within the block (blackpix / area);
    p_and:    continuous.        | Percentage of black pixels after the application of the Run Length Smoothing Algorithm (RLSA) (blackand / area);
    mean_tr:  continuous.      | Mean number of white-black transitions (blackpix / wb_trans);
    blackpix: integer.    | Total number of black pixels in the original bitmap of the block.
    blackand: integer.        | Total number of black pixels in the bitmap of the block after the RLSA.
    wb_trans: integer.          | Number of white-black transitions in the original bitmap of the block.
 
 
 
 7. Missing Attribute Values:  No missing value.
