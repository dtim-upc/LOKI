Description: Cervical cancer (Risk Factors) Data Set (multilabel classification)

The dataset was collected at 'Hospital Universitario de Caracas' in Caracas, Venezuela. The dataset comprises demographic information, habits, and historic medical records of 858 patients. Several patients decided not to answer some of the questions because of privacy concerns (missing values).

For the current dataset the target variable is a new columnd called "Class", which is the result of the logical OR operation between the columns "Biopsy" "Hinselmann", "Schiller" and "Citology".

{'Biopsy': 1, 'Hinselmann': 2, 'Schiller': 3, 'Citology': 4}, 0 if none of the targets are 1.
