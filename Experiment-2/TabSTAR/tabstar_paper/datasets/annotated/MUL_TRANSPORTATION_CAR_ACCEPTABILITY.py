**Car Evaluation Database**  
This database was derived from a simple hierarchical decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX (M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.).

The model evaluates cars according to the following concept structure:
 
    CAR                      car acceptability
    . PRICE                  overall price
    . . buying               buying price
    . . maint                price of the maintenance
    . TECH                   technical characteristics
    . . COMFORT              comfort
    . . . doors              number of doors
    . . . persons            capacity in terms of persons to carry
    . . . lug_boot           the size of luggage boot
    . . safety               estimated safety of the car
 
Input attributes are printed in lowercase. Besides the target concept (CAR), the model includes three intermediate concepts: PRICE, TECH, COMFORT. Every concept is in the original model related to its lower level descendants by a set of examples (for
these examples sets see http://www-ai.ijs.si/BlazZupan/car.html).
 
The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety. Because of known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.
