Dataset Name: Traffic_violations
====
Examples: 70340
====
URL: https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&id=42345
====
Description: This dataset contains traffic violation information from all electronic traffic violations issued in the County. Any information that can be used to uniquely identify the vehicle, the vehicle owner or the officer issuing the violation will not be published. For this version, some features were removed and all remaining character features were recoded as nominal factor variables. All punctuation characters were removed from factor levels.
                      The variable 'Violation.Type' is used as target by default. The smaller target categories 'SERO' and 'ESERO' were collapsed into one category labeled 'SERO'. For this version, the dataset was downsampled to 5% of the original size. Unused factor levels and a few almost constant features were dropped.
