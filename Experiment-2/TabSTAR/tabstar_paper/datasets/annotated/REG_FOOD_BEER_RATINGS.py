Beer Profile and Ratings Data Set
Beer Dataset with Tasting Profiles and Consumer Ratings

About Dataset
Data Set Information
This data set contains tasting profiles and consumer reviews for 3197 unique beers from 934 different breweries. It was created by integrating information from two existing data sets on Kaggle:

Beer Tasting Profiles Dataset
1.5 Million Beer Reviews
The purpose of the data integration is to create a new data set that contains comprehensive consumer review (appearance, aroma, palate, taste and overall review scores) for different brews, combined with their detailed tasting profiles—this is that data set.

In the future it might be possible to go through and scrape more detailed information for each brew, such as the brewery's country of origin or brew recipe information such as its original gravity vs. final gravity.

Contents
The main data set (beer_profile_and_ratings.csv) contains the following columns:

1 - Name: Beer name (label)
2 - Style: Beer Style
3 - Brewery: Brewery name
4 - Beer Name (Full): Complete beer name (Brewery + Brew Name) -- unique identifier for each beer
5 - Description: Notes on the beer if available
6 - ABV: Alcohol content of beer (% by volume)
7 - Min IBU: The minimum IBU value each beer can possess. IBU was not a value available for each beer, but the IBU range for each style was
8 - Max IBU: The maximum IBU value each beer can possess. IBU was not a value available for each beer, but the IBU range for each style was

The next eleven columns represent the tasting profile features of the beer, and are defined by word counts found in up to 25 reviews of each beer. The assumption is that people writing reviews are more than likely describing what they do experience rather than what they do not. (Refer to the file Beer Descriptors Simplified to see the list of words that are used to calculate the values contained in each of the feature columns below)

(Mouthfeel)
9 - Astringency
10 - Body
11 - Alcohol

(Taste)
12 - Bitter
13 - Sweet
14 - Sour
15 - Salty

(Flavor And Aroma)
16 - Fruits
17 - Hoppy
18 - Spices
19 - Malty

The last six columns contain information from beer reviews--they include the number (count) of consumer/user reviews, the average overall rating score, and the average rating scores for the aroma, appearance, palate, and taste of each individual beer.

20 - review _ aroma
21 - review _ appearance
22 - review _ palate
23 - review _ taste
24 - review _ overall
25 - number _ of _ reviews

The next two files (Brewery Name Fuzzy Match List.csv and Beer Name Fuzzy Match List.csv) only contain lists of breweries and beers that are found in both source datasets--and consequently, included in this dataset. To see the data integration process in more details, check out this notebook.

Description (object, 1841 distinct): ['Notes:', 'Notes:21 IBU\\t', "Notes:O'Doul's and O'Doul's Amber are non-alcohol malt beverages.O’Doul’s has a mild, sweet taste with a slightly dry finish. O’Doul’s Amber has a rich, slightly sweet taste with flavorful hop finish. O’Doul’s and O’Doul’s Amber are brewed as traditional premium beers – fermented and aged to full maturity. The alcohol is then removed through the use of low temperature, low-pressure distillation. This extremely gentle process allows the alcohol to be removed without heating or cooking the beer, which retains the full, rich and delicate flavor and balance of our non-alcohol brews.\\t", 'Notes:A Silver Medal winner in Strong Ales at the 1996 Great American Beer Festival. This Irish-style strong ale is brewed with a secret blend of five imported specialty malts. Not too hoppy in order to emphasize the complex malt flavor and fruity aroma.25 IBU\\t', 'Notes:22 IBU\\t', 'Notes:20 IBU\\t', 'Notes:Busch and Busch Light are both brewed with a blend of premium American-grown and imported hops and a combination of malt and corn to provide a pleasant balanced flavor. Additionally, Busch Light undergoes a longer brewing process that produces a lighter body and fewer calories.\\t', 'Notes:Munich and various roasted malts give it a very malty, rich flavor with a hint of burnt flavor. 100% imported Hallertau hops, moderate bitterness and aroma.\\t', 'Notes:The essence of Christmas is captured in this very bottle. Perfectly blended spices compliment Frosted Frog’s rich malt flavors, creating the ultimate Christmas experience. Celebrate the holidays as you savor this very special seasonal offering.\\t', 'Notes:Down in Kentucky and across the pond in Scotland, distillers who age their whiskeys for many years refer to the evaporation of the spirits from their barrels as “The Angel’s Share.” We couldn’t agree more. Each time a barrel is filled, a measure of liquid seeps into the oak and is lost for good.This striking Strong Ale is brewed with copious amounts of Caramel malt to emphasize the vanilla and oak flavors found in freshly emptied bourbon or brandy barrels. The beer spends a year in oak before it is packaged for release.\\t']
