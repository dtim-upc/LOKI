RM       average number of rooms per dwelling
AGE      proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
DIS      weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
RAD      index of accessibility to radial highways
TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town
B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
