    -- Test set performance (final 1044 examples, first 3133 used for training):
 	24.86% Cascade-Correlation (no hidden nodes)
 	26.25% Cascade-Correlation (5 hidden nodes)
 	21.5%  C4.5
 	 0.0%  Linear Discriminate Analysis
 	 3.57% k=5 Nearest Neighbour
       (Problem encoded as a classification task)
 
    -- Data set samples are highly overlapped.  Further information is required
 	to separate completely using affine combinations.  Other restrictions
 	to data set examined.

    Dystal and Backpropagation", submitted to the Australian Conference on
    Neural Networks (ACNN'96). Data set treated as a 3-category classification
    problem (grouping ring classes 1-8, 9 and 10, and 11 on).
 
    -- Test set performance (3133 training, 1044 testing as above):
 	64%    Backprop
 	55%    Dystal
    -- Previous work (Waugh, 1995) on same data set:
 	61.40% Cascade-Correlation (no hidden nodes)

 4. Relevant Information Paragraph:
 
    Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements.  The age of
    abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it,
    and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and
    time-consuming task.  Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are
    used to predict the age.  Further information, such as weather patterns
    and location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem.
 
    From the original data examples with missing values were removed (the
    majority having the predicted value missing), and the ranges of the
    continuous values have been scaled for use with an ANN (by dividing by 200).
 
    Data comes from an original (non-machine-learning) study:
 
 	Warwick J Nash, Tracy L Sellers, Simon R Talbot, Andrew J Cawthorn and
 	Wes B Ford (1994) "The Population Biology of Abalone (_Haliotis_
 	species) in Tasmania. I. Blacklip Abalone (_H. rubra_) from the North
 	Coast and Islands of Bass Strait", Sea Fisheries Division, Technical
 	Report No. 48 (ISSN 1034-3288)
 
 
 5. Number of Instances: 4177
 
 
 6. Number of Attributes: 8
 
 
 7. Attribute information:
 
    Given is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and a
    brief description.  The number of rings is the value to predict: either
    as a continuous value or as a classification problem.
