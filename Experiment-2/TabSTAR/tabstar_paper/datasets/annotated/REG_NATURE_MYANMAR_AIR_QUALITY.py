Dataset Name: Myanmar-Air-Quality(2019-to-2020-Oct)

Description: Context
Since Myanmar is one of the developing countries, a lot of factories were set up and the number of cars increased speedily during the previous years. Therefore, Myanmar's air quality was also dramatically decreasing during the last years. Moreover,  Myanmar air quality reached no.4 in the worst air quality globally in 2019. So, I created this dataset to analyze and to try some predictions.
Content
Data is from Purple.com and cleaned by using PowerBI. 
Acknowledgements
This dataset is a part of the project which is initialized to compete Myanmar's air quality visualization competitions. So, I would like to give credits to my friends who participated in that competition with me. 
Inspiration
I hope this dataset can help the field of data science and the air quality of Myanmar. Context
