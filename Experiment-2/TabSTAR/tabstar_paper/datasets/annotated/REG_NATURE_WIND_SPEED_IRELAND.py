Description: **Author**:   
**Source**: Unknown - Date unknown  
**Please cite**:   

wind   daily average wind speeds for 1961-1978 at 12 synoptic meteorological
stations in the Republic of Ireland (Haslett and raftery 1989).

These data were analyzed in detail in the following article:
Haslett, J. and Raftery, A. E. (1989). Space-time Modelling with
Long-memory Dependence: Assessing Ireland's Wind Power Resource
(with Discussion). Applied Statistics 38, 1-50.

Each line corresponds to one day of data in the following format:
year, month, day, average wind speed at each of the stations in the order given
in Fig.4 of Haslett and Raftery :
RPT, VAL, ROS, KIL, SHA, BIR, DUB, CLA, MUL, CLO, BEL, MAL

Fortan format : ( i2, 2i3, 12f6.2)

The data are in knots, not in m/s.

Permission granted for unlimited distribution.

Please report all anomalies to fraley@stat.washington.edu

Be aware that the dataset is 532494 bytes long (thats over half a
Megabyte).  Please be sure you want the data before you request it.
