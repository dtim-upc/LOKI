This dataset contains QSAR data (from ChEMBL version 17) showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI50) of several compounds on drug target TID: 10980, and it has 5766 rows and 1026 features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50). The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
