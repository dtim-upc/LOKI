Dataset Name: sulfur
====
Examples: 10081
====
URL: https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&id=44145
====
Description: Dataset used in the tabular data benchmark https://github.com/LeoGrin/tabular-benchmark, transformed in the same way. This dataset belongs to the "regression on numerical features" benchmark. Original description: 
 
&quot;The sulfur recovery unit (SRU) removes environmental pollutants from acid gas
streams before they are released into the atmosphere. Furthermore, elemental sulfur
is recovered as a valuable by-product.&quot;

5 inputs variables are gas and air flows.
2 outputs to predict are H2S and SO2 concentrations
