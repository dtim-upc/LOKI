About Dataset
Context

Content
Each row represents a movie available on FilmTV.it, with the original title, year, genre, duration, country, director, actors, average vote and votes.
The fie in the English version contains 41,399 movies and 19 attributes, while the Italian version contains one extra-attribute for the local title used when the movie was published in Italy.

Acknowledgements
Data has been scraped from the publicly available website https://www.filmtv.it as of 2023-10-21.
