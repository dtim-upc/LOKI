17x17x2x2 tables of counts in GLIM-ready format used for the analyses
in Biblarz, Timothy J., and Adrian E. Raftery. 1993. "The Effects of
Family Disruption on Social Mobility." American Sociological Review
(In press). For further details of the data, see this reference.
Column 1 is father's occupation, coded as follows:
17. Professional, Self-Employed
16. Professional-Salaried
15. Manager
14. Salesman-Nonretail
13. Proprietor
12. Clerk
11. Salesman-Retail
10. Craftsman-Manufacturing
9. Craftsmen-Other
8. Craftsman-Construction
7. Service Worker
6. Operative-Nonmanufacturing
5. Operative-Manufacturing
4. Laborer-Manufacturing
3. Laborer-Nonmanufacturing
2. Farmer/Farm Manager
1. Farm Laborer
Column 2 is son's occupation, coded in the same way as father's.
Column 3 is family structure, coded 1=intact family background and
2=nonintact family background.
Column 4 is race, coded 1=white and 2=black.
Column 5 is counts for son's first occupation.
Column 6 is counts for son's current occupation.
The counts have been weighted to take account of the survey
design, which is why they are not integers.
