Description: Context
This Dataset was created for an University project in Milan. The goal of the project was to create a Robust Model to predict the All Star Game score for each player. 
The score is calculated by dividing the players by conference and position held in the field (external or internal),
the athletes are ranked in descending order depending on the number of votes taken for each category
voter, so as to obtain three different rankings. From these for each player the rank is calculated (1st
Position involves Rank = 1, 2nd Position Rank = 2 etc. . . ). With the values obtained then an average is calculated
weighed, with weight 0.50 to that of the votes of the fans and 0.25 to the two remaining.
Doing this work we have merged some datasets from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/noahgift/social-power-nba),  basketball-reference.com  and hoopshype.com.
Obviously for our work we didn't use all of the variables and for a problem of indipendent observations we took only the last seasons' observation for each player.
Other analysis could be performed using salary as a target but also a cluster analysis for players or a PCA.
We wouldn't be here without the help of others. Thank you Riccardo,Alfredo and Daniel.
